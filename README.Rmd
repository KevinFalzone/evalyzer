The goal of evalyzer, which is an unofficial package, is to provide several functions to extract user testing data from the Evalyzer platform quickly and easily.

## Installation

You can install the development version of evalyzer like so:

``` r
library(devtools)

devtools::install_github("KevinFalzone/evalyzer")
```

## Login
To extract the data you need first to authenticate to the Evalyzer platform using the `auth()` function.

``` r
session <- auth("my-username", "my-password")
```

## Data Extraction
Several functions have been created to extract data:

* `get_overview()`
* `get_configuration()`
* `get_behavior()`
* `get_performance()`
* `get_answer()`
* `get_video()`

### Overview
The `get_overview()` function retrieves a summary of the user tests. The table contains for each user:

* the date and time of the test session,
* the task performances (task duration and task status),
* the total duration of the task(s).

``` r
session <- auth("my-username", "my-password")

user_overview <- get_overview(session, "project-id")
```

### Configuration
The `get_configuration()` function extracts for each user the setup information. The table contains for each user:

* the screen resolution,
* the browser name (e.g., Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, etc.),
* the operating system name (e.g., Windows, MacOS, GNU/Linux, etc.).

``` r
session <- auth("my-username", "my-password")

user_configuration <- get_configuration(session, "project-id")
```

### Behaviors
The `get_behavior()` function extracts for each user the behaviors he performed during each task:

* the behavior type (e.g., a clic, a scroll, etc.),
* the timestamp behavior (in milliseconds),
* the URL where the behavior occurred.

``` r
session <- auth("my-username", "my-password")

user_behavior <- get_behavior(session, "project-id")
```

### Performances
The `get_performance()` function retrieves for each user the duration and status of the task and a summary of behavioral data (i.e., it sums clics, scrolls, page loads).

``` r
session <- auth("my-username", "my-password")

user_performance <- get_performance(session, "project-id")
```

### Answers
The `get_answer()`function extracts the answers to the questions.

``` r
session <- auth("my-username", "my-password")

user_answer <- get_answer(session, "project-id")
```

### Videos
The `get_video()`function permits to retrieve the videos for each task of each user.

``` r
session <- auth("my-username", "my-password")

get_video(session, "project-id", "path-to-store-files")
```
